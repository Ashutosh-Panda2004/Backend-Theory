# How the Internet Works When You Search for a URL

1. **DNS Lookup**:  
   When you enter a URL, your browser contacts a Domain Name System (DNS) server to convert the human-readable URL (like `example.com`) into an IP address, which identifies the server hosting the website.

2. **Signal Transmission**:  
   Your request is transmitted from your device (laptop, phone, etc.) to your router. The router sends the data to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If you're using Wi-Fi, your data is sent as radio waves to your router, which then sends it to your ISP's network.

3. **ISP Routing**:  
   The ISP routes your request over its network. It checks if the requested website is accessible (i.e., not blocked or blacklisted), and then forwards the request through multiple network nodes (like hubs, routers, and data centers) until it reaches the destination server.

4. **Server Response**:  
   Once your request reaches the server hosting the website, the server processes it and sends the requested webpage data back. This return data follows the same path back to your device through the ISPâ€™s network.

5. **Rendering**:  
   Your browser takes the data from the server (usually in the form of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and displays the webpage you requested.

**Note**:  
The transmission from your device to the nearest hub or tower is often a combination of radio waves (for wireless communication) and electrical signals (for wired connections). However, the routing and data delivery between servers and networks mainly happen over high-speed fiber optic cables, which use light pulses to transmit data rapidly over long distances.
