# How the Internet Works When You Search for a URL

1. **DNS Lookup**:  
   When you enter a URL, your browser contacts a Domain Name System (DNS) server to convert the human-readable URL (like `example.com`) into an IP address, which identifies the server hosting the website.

2. **Signal Transmission**:  
   Your request is transmitted from your device (laptop, phone, etc.) to your router. The router sends the data to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If you're using Wi-Fi, your data is sent as radio waves to your router, which then sends it to your ISP's network.

3. **ISP Routing**:  
   The ISP routes your request over its network. It checks if the requested website is accessible (i.e., not blocked or blacklisted), and then forwards the request through multiple network nodes (like hubs, routers, and data centers) until it reaches the destination server.

4. **Server Response**:  
   Once your request reaches the server hosting the website, the server processes it and sends the requested webpage data back. This return data follows the same path back to your device through the ISP’s network.

5. **Rendering**:  
   Your browser takes the data from the server (usually in the form of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and displays the webpage you requested.

---

**Note**:  
The transmission from your device to the nearest hub or tower is often a combination of radio waves (for wireless communication) and electrical signals (for wired connections). However, the routing and data delivery between servers and networks mainly happen over high-speed fiber optic cables, which use light pulses to transmit data rapidly over long distances.

# What is an IP Address?

An **IP address** is like the address of your device on the internet. It’s assigned by your **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** whenever your device connects to the internet. This allows your device to communicate with websites, services, and other devices. The assignment of IP address is based on a protocol called DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). 

There are two main types of IP addresses:

1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)**:
   - This is the older version and looks something like this: `192.168.1.1`.
   - It uses 32-bit numbers, which means there are about 4.3 billion unique addresses available.
   - However, because so many devices are connected to the internet today, we started running out of IPv4 addresses.

2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)**:
   - This is the newer version and looks like this: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
   - It uses 128-bit numbers, which provides **trillions** of unique addresses, solving the shortage problem.
   - This is why IPv6 was created—to ensure there are enough addresses for all the devices connecting to the internet now and in the future.

## Difference Between Public and Private IPs

- **Public IP Address**:  
  A public IP is the address that is assigned to your device by your ISP and is visible on the internet. When you visit a website, your public IP is used to communicate with servers across the web.

- **Private IP Address**:  
  A private IP is assigned to devices within your local network (like your home Wi-Fi). For example, your computer, phone, and smart devices might have private IP addresses like `192.168.0.5` or `10.0.0.2`. These addresses are not visible to the outside world and are used only for communication within your home network.


Think of your **private IP** like a **nickname** that your family or close friends use at home—it's only used within your private circle. 

On the other hand, your **public IP** is like your **formal name (Ashutosh Panda)** that is used outside, like at school or in public spaces, to identify you to the world.

---

In simple terms, **public IP** is used to communicate with the world, and **private IP** is used to communicate with devices in your home or office network.

# What is a MAC Address?

A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a unique identifier given to a device's network card, allowing it to communicate on a local network like Wi-Fi or Ethernet. It is a hardware address that is hardcoded into your device's network card by the manufacturer.

### Key Points:

1. **Format**:
   - A MAC address is a 12-character code, often separated by colons or hyphens.
   - Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` or `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E`.

2. **Purpose**:
   - It is used to identify devices on a local network.
   - Works on the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model.

3. **Uniqueness**:
   - Every MAC address is supposed to be unique to each device.

4. **Types of MAC Addresses**:
   - **Unicast MAC**: For a single device.
   - **Multicast MAC**: For multiple devices.
   - **Broadcast MAC**: For all devices in the network.

5. **Static Nature**:
   - Unlike an IP address, a MAC address is usually **permanent** and does not change.

6. **Difference Between MAC and IP Address**:
   - **MAC Address**: Identifies a device on a local network.
   - **IP Address**: Identifies a device across the internet.

7. **Security**:
   - MAC addresses can be **spoofed** (faked) to pretend to be another device.

8. **Uses**:
   - MAC addresses are used in **Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth** to manage how devices talk to each other.

---

### Example Interview Question:

**Q**: *What's the difference between a MAC address and an IP address?*  
**A**: A MAC address is a hardware identifier unique to a device, used on local networks. An IP address is assigned to the device to identify it across the internet.

# What is a Proxy in Computer Networking?

A **proxy** in computer networking is a server that acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet. When you use a proxy server, your internet traffic is routed through it before reaching the website or service you're trying to access. This can help with functions like security, privacy, or bypassing restrictions.

### How Does a Proxy Work?

1. You send a request (like accessing a website) to the proxy server.
2. The proxy forwards the request to the destination website.
3. The website responds to the proxy, which then sends the response back to you.

In this way, the proxy acts as a middleman, hiding your IP address and making it seem like the request came from the proxy instead of your actual device.

### Uses of a Proxy:

1. **Privacy**: It hides your IP address, providing some level of anonymity online.
2. **Security**: Can filter and block malicious content.
3. **Access Control**: Restricts access to certain websites or content.
4. **Bypassing Restrictions**: Can be used to bypass geo-restrictions or local network restrictions.

---

### Example Scenario (University Network):

In a university, students might be restricted from accessing specific websites, like social media or streaming platforms. To enforce this, the university can set up a **proxy server**. When a student tries to access a blocked site, the proxy checks the requested website against a list of restricted sites. If it’s on the list, the proxy denies access, showing a message like "Access Denied."

Conversely, some students might try to bypass the university’s restrictions by setting up their own **proxy** or using a public one. By doing this, their traffic would be routed through that external proxy, making it appear like they’re accessing the site from outside the university network, allowing them to access restricted content.

---

### Interview-Friendly Explanation:

**Q**: _What is a proxy in computer networking, and how is it used?_  
**A**: A proxy is a server that sits between a user’s device and the internet. It forwards requests to websites and services on behalf of the user, often hiding their IP address. Proxies can be used for privacy, security, or controlling access. For example, in universities, a proxy server may block access to certain websites by checking all traffic and denying requests for restricted sites.

# What is a VPN?

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. It routes your internet traffic through a VPN server, which hides your IP address and encrypts your data, making it unreadable to outsiders.

### Key Points:

1. **Encryption**:
   - VPNs encrypt your data, which protects your information from being read by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), government agencies, or any third parties.

2. **Privacy**:
   - By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, VPNs help maintain your online privacy and anonymity.

3. **Secure Access**:
   - VPNs allow you to securely access restricted or geo-blocked content by making it appear as though you are accessing the internet from a different location.

4. **Protection on Public Networks**:
   - VPNs are particularly useful on public Wi-Fi networks, where they protect your data from potential interception by hackers.

---

## Difference Between VPN and Proxy

1. **Encryption**:
   - **VPN**: Encrypts your internet traffic, making it secure from eavesdroppers, including your ISP and government agencies.
   - **Proxy**: Does not encrypt your traffic. Your data is visible to your ISP and other entities.

2. **Privacy**:
   - **VPN**: Provides enhanced privacy by hiding your IP address and encrypting your data.
   - **Proxy**: Hides your IP address but does not provide encryption. Your data can still be intercepted and read.

3. **Scope of Protection**:
   - **VPN**: Secures all your internet traffic, regardless of the application or website you are using.
   - **Proxy**: Typically only affects the traffic of specific applications or browsers configured to use the proxy.

4. **Usage**:
   - **VPN**: Suitable for comprehensive privacy and security, particularly when using public Wi-Fi or accessing sensitive information.
   - **Proxy**: Often used for bypassing content restrictions or accessing blocked websites, but not suitable for secure, encrypted communication.

---

### Interview-Friendly Explanation:

**Q**: _What is a VPN, and how does it differ from a proxy?_  
**A**: A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet, protecting your data from being read by your ISP or third parties. It also hides your IP address and allows you to access restricted content securely. In contrast, a proxy server acts as an intermediary that hides your IP address but does not encrypt your traffic, meaning your data can still be accessed by your ISP or other entities.

# Client-Server Architecture

**Client-Server Architecture** is a model for designing networked applications where the workload is divided between clients and servers. It is a fundamental concept in both backend engineering and the broader internet ecosystem.

## Components

1. **Client**:
   - **Definition**: The client is the end-user device or application that requests resources or services from the server. This can be a web browser, mobile app, or desktop application.
   - **Function**: Sends requests to the server and displays the server's responses to the user.

2. **Server**:
   - **Definition**: The server is a powerful computer or software application that provides resources, services, or data to clients. Servers can be dedicated machines or cloud-based systems.
   - **Function**: Receives and processes requests from clients, performs necessary operations, and sends responses back to clients.

## How It Works

1. **Request**:
   - The client sends a request to the server. For example, when you enter a URL in a web browser, the browser (client) sends a request to the web server.

2. **Processing**:
   - The server processes the request. This may involve querying a database, performing calculations, or retrieving data.

3. **Response**:
   - The server sends the response back to the client. This might be a web page, data, or an error message.

4. **Display**:
   - The client displays the response to the user. For example, the web browser renders the web page for you to view.

## Key Points in Client-Server Architecture

- **Scalability**: Servers can handle multiple clients simultaneously, allowing the system to scale with increased demand.
- **Centralization**: Servers centralize resources and services, making them easier to manage and maintain.
- **Security**: Servers can enforce security measures and control access to resources.
- **Maintenance**: Updates and maintenance are easier to manage since they are performed on the server rather than on each client.

## Common Interview Questions and Answers

1. **Q**: _What is Client-Server Architecture?_
   - **A**: Client-Server Architecture is a network model where client devices or applications request services or resources from a centralized server. The server processes these requests and returns the required data or services to the client.

2. **Q**: _What are the main components of a Client-Server system?_
   - **A**: The main components are the client (which requests services or data) and the server (which provides the requested services or data).

3. **Q**: _How does a Client-Server interaction work?_
   - **A**: The client sends a request to the server. The server processes the request, performs necessary operations, and sends a response back to the client, which then displays the result to the user.

4. **Q**: _What are some advantages of Client-Server Architecture?_
   - **A**: Advantages include scalability (handling multiple clients), centralization (easier management and updates), security (centralized control), and easier maintenance.

5. **Q**: _What is the difference between a client and a server?_
   - **A**: A client requests services or resources from a server, while the server provides these services or resources. Clients typically interact directly with users, while servers handle the processing and storage of data.

6. **Q**: _What is meant by "scalability" in the context of Client-Server Architecture?_
   - **A**: Scalability refers to the system's ability to handle an increasing number of clients or requests. A well-designed client-server system can manage more users or higher loads by upgrading the server or distributing the load.

7. **Q**: _How does Client-Server Architecture ensure security?_
   - **A**: Security is managed through authentication, authorization, and encryption on the server side. The server controls access to resources and ensures data is securely transmitted and stored.

8. **Q**: _What are some common types of servers in a Client-Server system?_
   - **A**: Common types of servers include web servers (serve web pages), database servers (store and manage databases), and application servers (run applications and process data).

# Reverse Proxy: Your Invisible Guardian

A **reverse proxy** is a server that sits between client devices and the backend servers they want to access. Unlike a traditional proxy, which acts on behalf of the client, a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server. It manages and directs incoming client requests to one or more backend servers.

Technically, **Reverse Proxy** is set up by the server in such a way that all the requests before reaching the backend server, goes through the **Reverse Proxy server** which further verifies that there is no malicious things in the request and it also verifies that whether the person has been sending multiple requests in a specific time period and if the request passes all the verification tests after then it is sent to the backend server, **So basically we use Reverse Proxy mainly for Rate Limiting**.

## How a Reverse Proxy Works

1. **Client Request**:
   - A client makes a request to access a website or service.

2. **Reverse Proxy Handling**:
   - The request is first directed to the reverse proxy server instead of directly to the backend server.

3. **Request Forwarding**:
   - The reverse proxy evaluates the request and forwards it to the appropriate backend server.

4. **Backend Server Response**:
   - The backend server processes the request and sends the response back to the reverse proxy.

5. **Response to Client**:
   - The reverse proxy then sends the response back to the client.

## Benefits of Using a Reverse Proxy

1. **Load Balancing**:
   - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to balance the load and ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

2. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Acts as an additional layer of security by hiding the backend server’s IP addresses and protecting against direct attacks.

3. **Caching**:
   - Caches frequently requested content to improve performance and reduce the load on backend servers.

4. **SSL Termination**:
   - Handles SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, offloading this resource-intensive task from the backend servers.

5. **Compression**:
   - Compresses outgoing data to reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times for clients.

6. **Request Filtering**:
   - Can filter and block harmful or unwanted requests before they reach the backend servers.

7. **Application Firewall**:
   - Provides additional protection by filtering requests based on specific rules and security policies.

## Common Use Cases

- **Web Hosting**: Directs requests to multiple web servers based on load, user location, or content type.
- **API Management**: Routes API requests to different services and handles authentication and rate limiting.
- **Content Delivery**: Caches and delivers static content to improve performance and reduce server load.

## Interview-Friendly Explanation

**Q**: _What is a reverse proxy, and what are its benefits?_  
**A**: A reverse proxy is a server that sits between clients and backend servers. It forwards client requests to the appropriate backend server and then sends the server’s response back to the client. The benefits include load balancing (distributing traffic across multiple servers), enhanced security (hiding backend server IPs), caching (improving performance), SSL termination (handling encryption), and request filtering (protecting against harmful requests).

# Normal Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy

## Normal Proxy

- **Who It Represents**: The **client** (like your web browser).
- **Purpose**: Hides the client's IP address and makes requests to websites on behalf of the client.
- **Use Case**: Useful for privacy or accessing blocked content.

## Reverse Proxy

- **Who It Represents**: The **server** (like a website or application server).
- **Purpose**: Hides the server's IP address and handles requests from clients, then forwards them to backend servers.
- **Use Case**: Useful for load balancing, security, and caching on the server side.

---

In summary, a normal proxy acts on behalf of the client, while a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server.

# Understanding Internet Protocols

Internet protocols are fundamental rules that enable data exchange across the internet. They ensure compatibility and communication between different systems. Below are detailed definitions and examples of some key internet protocols:

## 1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

- **Definition**: HTTP is the protocol used for transferring hypertext (web pages) between clients (like web browsers) and servers. It operates at the application layer of the OSI model and is designed to facilitate the retrieval of web content.
- **Example**: When you type `www.example.com` into your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website. The server responds with the requested web page, which is then rendered in your browser.

## 2. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)

- **Definition**: HTTPS is an extension of HTTP that adds a layer of security by using SSL/TLS encryption. This ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and protected from interception and tampering.
- **Example**: On an online shopping site, HTTPS encrypts your payment information and personal details, making it secure from eavesdroppers. This is crucial for transactions and sensitive data exchanges.

## 3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

- **Definition**: FTP is used to transfer files between a client and a server over a network. It supports both uploading and downloading of files and operates on the application layer. FTP typically uses two separate channels: one for commands and one for data transfer.
- **Example**: If you upload a website's files to a hosting server or download a software package from a server, you use FTP. For instance, using an FTP client like FileZilla to upload your website's files to your web host.

## 4. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

- **Definition**: SMTP is the protocol used to send emails from a client to a server or between servers. It operates on the application layer and is responsible for the transfer of email messages across networks.
- **Example**: When you send an email from your Gmail account, SMTP is used to deliver your message from your email client to the Gmail server, and then from Gmail's server to the recipient’s email server.

## 5. POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)

- **Definition**: POP3 is used to retrieve emails from a mail server to a local email client. It downloads emails from the server to the client and typically removes them from the server, making them accessible offline.
- **Example**: When you check your emails with an email client like Microsoft Outlook, POP3 downloads the messages from the email server to your device, allowing you to read them even when you're not connected to the internet.

## 6. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)

- **Definition**: IMAP is used to access and manage email messages stored on a mail server. Unlike POP3, IMAP allows multiple devices to access and synchronize the same mailbox, keeping the emails on the server.
- **Example**: If you check your email on both your smartphone and laptop, IMAP ensures that your inbox is synchronized across all devices, so changes you make on one device (like deleting an email) are reflected on all devices.

## 7. DNS (Domain Name System)

- **Definition**: DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to locate each other on a network. It operates as a distributed database that maps domain names to IP addresses.
- **Example**: When you enter `www.example.com` into your browser, DNS resolves this domain name into the IP address of the server hosting the website, allowing your browser to connect to it.

## 8. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- **Definition**: TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission between devices. It establishes a connection, ensures that data is delivered accurately and in order, and handles retransmission of lost packets.
- **Example**: When you download a file or stream a video, TCP ensures that all parts of the file or video arrive correctly and in the right sequence, even if some packets are lost or corrupted during transmission.

## 9. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- **Definition**: UDP is a connectionless protocol that allows faster data transmission by sending packets without establishing a connection or ensuring their delivery. It does not guarantee order or reliability, making it suitable for applications where speed is more critical than accuracy.
- **Example**: Online gaming and live video streaming use UDP to send data quickly. The loss of some packets is acceptable in these applications as long as the data is delivered promptly.

---

### Interview-Friendly Explanation

**Q**: _What is HTTP, and how does it differ from HTTPS?_  
**A**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring web pages between clients and servers. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP that uses encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect data during transmission, ensuring that sensitive information like login credentials and payment details are kept secure.

**Q**: _What is the role of DNS in internet communication?_  
**A**: DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a domain name in your browser, DNS resolves it to the IP address of the server hosting the website, allowing your browser to connect to and retrieve the site.

**Q**: _How does TCP ensure reliable data transmission?_  
**A**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) establishes a connection between devices and ensures that data is transmitted accurately and in order. It handles error checking and retransmission of lost packets to ensure reliable communication.

# ISPs: Your Gateway to the Internet

## What is an ISP?

An **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** is a company or organization that provides individuals and businesses with access to the internet. ISPs offer various types of internet connections and services, enabling users to connect to and use the internet.

## How ISPs Work

1. **Connection to the Internet**:
   - ISPs have their own high-speed data lines that connect to the broader internet infrastructure. They often connect to larger networks and exchange data with other ISPs and network providers.

2. **Providing Access**:
   - ISPs distribute internet access to their customers via different types of connections, such as DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), cable, fiber-optic, satellite, or wireless. These connections bridge the user's device to the ISP’s network.

3. **Assigning IP Addresses**:
   - When you connect to the internet through an ISP, they assign an IP address to your device. This IP address is used to identify your device on the network and to route data between your device and other internet resources.

4. **Routing Traffic**:
   - ISPs handle the routing of data between your device and the websites or services you access. They direct incoming and outgoing data packets to and from your device, ensuring that your requests and responses are correctly transmitted.

5. **Providing Additional Services**:
   - Many ISPs offer additional services such as web hosting, email services, and security features. They may also provide customer support to help with connectivity issues or other internet-related concerns.

## Types of ISP Connections

- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**: Uses existing telephone lines to provide internet access. It offers moderate speeds and is widely available.
- **Cable**: Uses coaxial cable lines to provide internet access. It typically offers higher speeds than DSL and is often used in residential areas.
- **Fiber-Optic**: Uses light signals transmitted through fiber-optic cables to provide high-speed internet access. It offers very high speeds and is becoming increasingly available.
- **Satellite**: Uses satellites to provide internet access. It is useful in remote areas but may have higher latency and lower speeds compared to other types.
- **Wireless**: Includes various technologies such as Wi-Fi and cellular data, providing internet access through wireless signals.

## Example

Imagine you want to watch a video online. When you request the video, your device sends a request to the ISP. The ISP routes this request through their network to the server hosting the video. Once the server responds, the ISP routes the video data back to your device, allowing you to watch the video.

## Interview-Friendly Explanation

**Q**: _What is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and what role does it play in internet access?_  
**A**: An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that provides individuals and businesses with access to the internet. They connect users to the internet by offering various types of connections, such as DSL, cable, fiber-optic, satellite, or wireless. ISPs assign IP addresses to users, route data traffic, and often provide additional services like email and web hosting. Essentially, ISPs act as the gateway between users and the broader internet.

# Understanding TCP/IP Protocol

## What is TCP/IP?

**TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)** is a set of networking protocols that dictate how data is sent and received over the internet. It serves as the foundation of the internet and allows communication between different networks and devices.

TCP/IP is actually a suite of protocols that includes multiple layers, each with specific tasks to ensure reliable communication. It breaks down how data should be transmitted, routed, and received across the internet.

## The Four Layers of TCP/IP

TCP/IP is structured into **four layers**, each with specific functions:

1. **Application Layer**:
   - This is where the communication between networked applications occurs.
   - Protocols at this layer include **HTTP**, **FTP**, **SMTP**, and **DNS**.
   - Example: When you access a website using a web browser, the **HTTP** protocol operates at this layer.

2. **Transport Layer**:
   - The transport layer manages how data is transmitted between devices.
   - The two main protocols here are **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) and **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol).
   - **TCP** is used for reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data (e.g., sending an email or loading a webpage).
   - **UDP** is used for fast, connectionless transmission where speed is more important than reliability (e.g., live streaming or online gaming).
   
3. **Internet Layer**:
   - This layer handles the routing of data across networks. It ensures that data packets move from source to destination through potentially multiple networks.
   - The main protocol here is **IP** (Internet Protocol), which provides addressing (via **IP addresses**) to ensure data is delivered to the correct location.
   - Example: **IP** routes data across the internet to the correct recipient.

4. **Network Access Layer**:
   - This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over the network (e.g., through Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
   - It defines how data should be transmitted over the physical media (like cables, radio waves) to reach the next device on the network.

## How TCP/IP Works Together

Here's a step-by-step overview of how TCP/IP protocols work when you load a webpage:

1. **Application Layer**: Your web browser (using HTTP) sends a request to a web server to load a page.
2. **Transport Layer**: TCP breaks the request into smaller packets and ensures that each one is transmitted reliably. If any packet is lost, TCP will request its retransmission.
3. **Internet Layer**: Each packet is assigned an IP address, which determines the source and destination of the data. The packet is then routed across multiple networks.
4. **Network Access Layer**: The data is physically transmitted over cables or wirelessly to the next network node, which could be a router or switch. This process continues until the packet reaches its destination.

Once the server receives the packets, it uses the reverse process to respond, sending the data back in a similar manner.

## TCP vs. UDP

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: 
  - Ensures reliable data transmission by establishing a connection between devices. It verifies that all packets are received and assembled correctly.
  - Example: Loading a website, sending an email.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: 
  - Focuses on speed over reliability. It does not verify if all packets arrive in order.
  - Example: Streaming video, online gaming.

## Why TCP/IP is Important

TCP/IP enables the internet to function efficiently. It breaks down data into manageable packets, routes them across networks, and reassembles them on the other side, ensuring reliable communication between devices. Without TCP/IP, communication between different networks would be unreliable and chaotic.

## Interview-Friendly Explanation

**Q**: _What is TCP/IP, and why is it important?_
**A**: **TCP/IP** is a set of networking protocols that governs how data is transmitted and received over the internet. It has four layers: the application layer (where applications like web browsers interact), the transport layer (responsible for reliable data transmission using TCP or fast transmission using UDP), the internet layer (which handles routing using IP addresses), and the network access layer (which handles physical data transmission). TCP/IP ensures reliable communication between different devices on the internet, making it the backbone of modern networking.

---

**Q**: _What’s the difference between TCP and UDP?_
**A**: **TCP** is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked data delivery. It's used for applications where reliability is crucial, such as loading a website or sending an email. **UDP**, on the other hand, is a connectionless protocol that focuses on speed, used in cases like online gaming or video streaming where speed is more important than perfect data transmission.
