# How the Internet Works When You Search for a URL

1. **DNS Lookup**:  
   When you enter a URL, your browser contacts a Domain Name System (DNS) server to convert the human-readable URL (like `example.com`) into an IP address, which identifies the server hosting the website.

2. **Signal Transmission**:  
   Your request is transmitted from your device (laptop, phone, etc.) to your router. The router sends the data to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If you're using Wi-Fi, your data is sent as radio waves to your router, which then sends it to your ISP's network.

3. **ISP Routing**:  
   The ISP routes your request over its network. It checks if the requested website is accessible (i.e., not blocked or blacklisted), and then forwards the request through multiple network nodes (like hubs, routers, and data centers) until it reaches the destination server.

4. **Server Response**:  
   Once your request reaches the server hosting the website, the server processes it and sends the requested webpage data back. This return data follows the same path back to your device through the ISP’s network.

5. **Rendering**:  
   Your browser takes the data from the server (usually in the form of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and displays the webpage you requested.

**Note**:  
The transmission from your device to the nearest hub or tower is often a combination of radio waves (for wireless communication) and electrical signals (for wired connections). However, the routing and data delivery between servers and networks mainly happen over high-speed fiber optic cables, which use light pulses to transmit data rapidly over long distances.

# What is an IP Address?

An **IP address** is like the address of your device on the internet. It’s assigned by your **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** whenever your device connects to the internet. This allows your device to communicate with websites, services, and other devices. The assignment of IP address is based on a protocol called DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). 

There are two main types of IP addresses:

1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)**:
   - This is the older version and looks something like this: `192.168.1.1`.
   - It uses 32-bit numbers, which means there are about 4.3 billion unique addresses available.
   - However, because so many devices are connected to the internet today, we started running out of IPv4 addresses.

2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)**:
   - This is the newer version and looks like this: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
   - It uses 128-bit numbers, which provides **trillions** of unique addresses, solving the shortage problem.
   - This is why IPv6 was created—to ensure there are enough addresses for all the devices connecting to the internet now and in the future.

## Difference Between Public and Private IPs

- **Public IP Address**:  
  A public IP is the address that is assigned to your device by your ISP and is visible on the internet. When you visit a website, your public IP is used to communicate with servers across the web.

- **Private IP Address**:  
  A private IP is assigned to devices within your local network (like your home Wi-Fi). For example, your computer, phone, and smart devices might have private IP addresses like `192.168.0.5` or `10.0.0.2`. These addresses are not visible to the outside world and are used only for communication within your home network.


Think of your **private IP** like a **nickname** that your family or close friends use at home—it's only used within your private circle. 

On the other hand, your **public IP** is like your **formal name (Ashutosh Panda)** that is used outside, like at school or in public spaces, to identify you to the world.

---

In simple terms, **public IP** is used to communicate with the world, and **private IP** is used to communicate with devices in your home or office network.

# What is a MAC Address?

A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a unique identifier given to a device's network card, allowing it to communicate on a local network like Wi-Fi or Ethernet. It is a hardware address that is hardcoded into your device's network card by the manufacturer.

### Key Points:

1. **Format**:
   - A MAC address is a 12-character code, often separated by colons or hyphens.
   - Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` or `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E`.

2. **Purpose**:
   - It is used to identify devices on a local network.
   - Works on the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model.

3. **Uniqueness**:
   - Every MAC address is supposed to be unique to each device.

4. **Types of MAC Addresses**:
   - **Unicast MAC**: For a single device.
   - **Multicast MAC**: For multiple devices.
   - **Broadcast MAC**: For all devices in the network.

5. **Static Nature**:
   - Unlike an IP address, a MAC address is usually **permanent** and does not change.

6. **Difference Between MAC and IP Address**:
   - **MAC Address**: Identifies a device on a local network.
   - **IP Address**: Identifies a device across the internet.

7. **Security**:
   - MAC addresses can be **spoofed** (faked) to pretend to be another device.

8. **Uses**:
   - MAC addresses are used in **Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth** to manage how devices talk to each other.

### Example Interview Question:

**Q**: *What's the difference between a MAC address and an IP address?*  
**A**: A MAC address is a hardware identifier unique to a device, used on local networks. An IP address is assigned to the device to identify it across the internet.

# What is a Proxy in Computer Networking?

A **proxy** in computer networking is a server that acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet. When you use a proxy server, your internet traffic is routed through it before reaching the website or service you're trying to access. This can help with functions like security, privacy, or bypassing restrictions.

### How Does a Proxy Work?

1. You send a request (like accessing a website) to the proxy server.
2. The proxy forwards the request to the destination website.
3. The website responds to the proxy, which then sends the response back to you.

In this way, the proxy acts as a middleman, hiding your IP address and making it seem like the request came from the proxy instead of your actual device.

### Uses of a Proxy:

1. **Privacy**: It hides your IP address, providing some level of anonymity online.
2. **Security**: Can filter and block malicious content.
3. **Access Control**: Restricts access to certain websites or content.
4. **Bypassing Restrictions**: Can be used to bypass geo-restrictions or local network restrictions.

### Example Scenario (University Network):

In a university, students might be restricted from accessing specific websites, like social media or streaming platforms. To enforce this, the university can set up a **proxy server**. When a student tries to access a blocked site, the proxy checks the requested website against a list of restricted sites. If it’s on the list, the proxy denies access, showing a message like "Access Denied."

Conversely, some students might try to bypass the university’s restrictions by setting up their own **proxy** or using a public one. By doing this, their traffic would be routed through that external proxy, making it appear like they’re accessing the site from outside the university network, allowing them to access restricted content.

---

### Interview-Friendly Explanation:

**Q**: _What is a proxy in computer networking, and how is it used?_  
**A**: A proxy is a server that sits between a user’s device and the internet. It forwards requests to websites and services on behalf of the user, often hiding their IP address. Proxies can be used for privacy, security, or controlling access. For example, in universities, a proxy server may block access to certain websites by checking all traffic and denying requests for restricted sites.

# What is a VPN?

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. It routes your internet traffic through a VPN server, which hides your IP address and encrypts your data, making it unreadable to outsiders.

### Key Points:

1. **Encryption**:
   - VPNs encrypt your data, which protects your information from being read by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), government agencies, or any third parties.

2. **Privacy**:
   - By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, VPNs help maintain your online privacy and anonymity.

3. **Secure Access**:
   - VPNs allow you to securely access restricted or geo-blocked content by making it appear as though you are accessing the internet from a different location.

4. **Protection on Public Networks**:
   - VPNs are particularly useful on public Wi-Fi networks, where they protect your data from potential interception by hackers.

---

## Difference Between VPN and Proxy

1. **Encryption**:
   - **VPN**: Encrypts your internet traffic, making it secure from eavesdroppers, including your ISP and government agencies.
   - **Proxy**: Does not encrypt your traffic. Your data is visible to your ISP and other entities.

2. **Privacy**:
   - **VPN**: Provides enhanced privacy by hiding your IP address and encrypting your data.
   - **Proxy**: Hides your IP address but does not provide encryption. Your data can still be intercepted and read.

3. **Scope of Protection**:
   - **VPN**: Secures all your internet traffic, regardless of the application or website you are using.
   - **Proxy**: Typically only affects the traffic of specific applications or browsers configured to use the proxy.

4. **Usage**:
   - **VPN**: Suitable for comprehensive privacy and security, particularly when using public Wi-Fi or accessing sensitive information.
   - **Proxy**: Often used for bypassing content restrictions or accessing blocked websites, but not suitable for secure, encrypted communication.

---

### Interview-Friendly Explanation:

**Q**: _What is a VPN, and how does it differ from a proxy?_  
**A**: A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet, protecting your data from being read by your ISP or third parties. It also hides your IP address and allows you to access restricted content securely. In contrast, a proxy server acts as an intermediary that hides your IP address but does not encrypt your traffic, meaning your data can still be accessed by your ISP or other entities.
